JS Katas
========

The JS Katas is my journey to enlightenment in order to master
Javascript. The goal is to learn the Javascript, the language, how to
build a framework, tools, techniques, patterns, etc. We also practice
some culture. Testing is essential in the quest to learn and do great
things in the language.  


The Structure
-------------

The katas are independent projects that I perform one or more
times. Each kata builds up some knowledge of Javascript and builds upon itself.

Some katas are original exercises, other are taken from books.
