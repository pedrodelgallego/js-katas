ORM jQuery
==========

Object-relational mappers are typically used in languages
other than JavaScript. However, they’re a very useful technique for
data management as well as a great way of using models in your
JavaScript application. With an ORM, for example, you can tie up a
model with a remote server—any changes to model instances will send
background Ajax requests to the server. Or, you could tie up a model
instance with an HTML element—any changes to the instance will be
reflected in the view.
